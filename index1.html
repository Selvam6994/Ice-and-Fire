        <P><b><i> A Song of Ice and Fire</i> </b>is a series of epic fantasy novels by the American novelist and screenwriter <u> George R. R. Martin.</u> He began the first volume of the series, <mark> A Game of Thrones</mark>, in 1991, and it was published in 1996. Martin, who initially envisioned the series as a trilogy, has published five out of a planned seven volumes. The fifth and most recent volume of the series, <mark> A Dance with Dragons</mark>, was published in 2011, six years after the publication of the preceding book, <mark>A Feast for Crows</mark>. He is currently writing the sixth novel, <mark> Winds of Winter</mark>. A seventh novel, A Dream of Spring, is planned.</P>
        <p>A Song of Ice and Fire takes place on the fictional continents <mark> Westeros</mark> and <mark>Essos</mark> . <mark> The point of view</mark> of each chapter in the story is a <mark> limited </mark>perspective of a range of characters growing from nine in the first novel, to 31 characters by the fifth novel. Three main stories interweave: a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros, the rising threat of the supernatural <mark> Others</mark> in northernmost Westeros, and the ambition of the deposed king's exiled daughter to assume the <mark>Iron Throne</mark> .</p>
        <p>Martin's inspirations included the <mark> Wars of the Roses</mark>and the French <mark> historical novels <i>The Accursed Kings </i></mark>by <mark> Maurice Druon</mark>.An assortment of disparate and subjective points of view confronts the reader, and the success or survival of point-of-view characters is never assured. Within the often morally ambiguous world of A Song of Ice and Fire, questions concerning loyalty, pride, human sexuality, piety, and the morality of <mark> violence </mark>frequently arise.</p>
        <p>The books have sold 90 million copies worldwide as of April 2019,after having been translated into 47 languages as of January 2017.[6][7] The fourth and fifth volumes reached the top of the <mark> <i>New York Times</i>  Best Seller lists</mark> upon their releases.[8] Among the <mark> many derived works</mark> are <mark> several prequel novellas, a TV series,</mark> a <mark>comic book adaptation</mark> , and several,<mark> board,</mark> and <mark>video games.</mark> </p>
